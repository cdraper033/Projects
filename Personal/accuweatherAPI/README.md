I am currently working on a simple web application that allows you to input your zipcode and then it shows 
various things relating to weather, skywatching, pollen, etc. 

It is currently a work in progress.

What I'm using for this application:
- Accuweather API
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS


Future plans
- Add more than just weather
- Make this an app that utilizes React
